We're just going to add a bit of text. 

Just a quick test here for John...wanted to see how the edit works...I just right mouse clicked on the file from within SourceTree and it opened it in wordpad.  I assume I can change that to NotePad++ and all will be well.

This is another test...this time I added a diff tool...beyond compare so I want to see how it displays this change.

I'm adding this using beyond compare...it works just as you would expect.  I added it under the tools, options, diff settings and 
after that I just opened the settings icon on the file, selected external diff and it opened the file in Beyond Compare. Just the way 
you would want it to.  I like it...now lets see what it does with this note when I save it.
